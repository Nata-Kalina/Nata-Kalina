# Hi there! 👋 I'm Natasha! Welcome to my GitHub page!

🌱 I started my **Back-End Software Developer** path not so long ago. My journey began with **Code The Dream** with their **Full Stack Development: Node.js/Express** class. I'm a passionate about software development with a high interest in creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

## 🔍 What I'm Focusing On

- Enhancing my knowledge of **Node.js** and **Express.js** to build scalable web applications.
- More practice with databases like **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** library.
- Dive deeper into RESTful API development and understanding the best practices associated with it.

## 📚 My Next Steps Will Be

- A broader view of the back-end development with **Ruby on Rails Back End Class** from **Code The Dream**.
- Dive into front-end development with **React Front End Class** from **Code The Dream**.
- Patricipating in variety of projects to improve my skills, expand my knowledge and gain new experience.
